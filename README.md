## Installation Instructions

- This app is launched from the command line. Ensure all required libraries are imported via npm and the the db files have been properly sourced.
- Also note this application will require your unique root login in password for mysql if you want to run a local instance. The user should create their own .env file in the root directory.
- The user must seed the data from the command line to populate the database.
- To test the api calls I recommend running insomnia after the app is launched from the command line. Either npm start or nodemon server.js will work.
